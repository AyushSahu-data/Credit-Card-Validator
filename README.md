# Credit-Card-Validator

This is a small project that validates a user's credit card using Luhn's algorithm. The programme accepts all major credit cards, including Visa, American Express, and MasterCard. Luhn's algorithm checks for simple validations, such as a Visa card beginning with 4 and progressing to sophisticated digit-wise computations. Because most e-commerce transactions involve credit card validation.
